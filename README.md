A lot of code is messy. Live with it. It's a scripting challenge where the answer matters, not the way (though in a part it is, too)


# RUN CODE:
	- Day 1: node <filename.ts> after having installed node globally
	- tsx <filename.ts>
	- npm run file -- <filename.ts> which will run the former

Set the filename in the row that says getInput on the part#.ts . No, I didn't bother to make it easier on you. Human up, person!

May change as the event continues
